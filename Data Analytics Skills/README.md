# Data Analytics Skills

### Instructions
Load up the files, and try and identify some patterns in the data by slicing and dicing it.
This is a generated dataset where we've introduced some common problems.  We expect this to take between 1 and 2 hours, don't go as far as training a model.  We are interested in seeing clearly thought out, quick value.

For example, we want to see how you approach the popular business question; *What do the highest spending customers look like*?
Wrap up your analysis with business explanation of what you have found.

### Tooling
We prefer python and jupyter notebook, but you're welcome to use but you're welcome to use the tool that you are quickest with.
A good notebook stack can be found [here](https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks/tree/master/scipy-notebook).  We'd love to hear if you used docker; it's a core part of our Big Data Infrastructure!

Tell a story, make your analysis clear, and send us a pdf, html or source file containing your findings.

### Bonus Question:
Can you find the name of a country in Asia in the dataset?
